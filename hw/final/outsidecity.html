    <section>
    <p> Its location on the New England coast means Boston is one of the best places to live for people who need the occasional escape from city lifeâ€”coastal fishing towns, lush backwoods hiking trails, and beautiful beaches are never more than a quick drive away. Here are some of the best and most accessible ways to spend a little time out of the city. </p>

    <h2>Blue Hills</h2>
    <p>Located only minutes from the bustle of downtown Boston, the DCR Blue Hills Reservation stretches over 7,000 acres from Quincy to Dedham, Milton to Randolph, providing a green oasis in an urban environment. Rising above the horizon, Great Blue Hill reaches a height of 635 feet, the highest of the 22 hills in the Blue Hills chain. From the rocky summit visitors can see over the entire metropolitan area. With its scenic views, varied terrain and 125 miles of trails, the Blue Hills Reservation offers year-round enjoyment for the outdoor enthusiast.</p>

    <h2>Cape Cod</h2>
    <p>Cape Cod, a hook-shaped peninsula of the U.S. state of Massachusetts, is a popular summertime destination. It's the site of quaint villages, seafood shacks, lighthouses, ponds and bay and ocean beaches. In the large town of Hyannis, the John F. Kennedy Museum is the first stop on the Kennedy Legacy Trail through downtown, where ferries depart to the resort islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The Atlantic crashes on a coastline strewn with quaint harbors, windswept beaches, glorious dunes and blinking lighthouses. Explore Cape Cod National Seashore, bike past cranberry bogs on the Rail Trail or saunter around Sandwich, the Cape's oldest town. Many areas are architectural and culinary gems - full of weathered shingles, whaling captains' mansions, chowder shacks and upscale dining delights. Don't miss Woods Hole Oceanquest, famed Martha's Vineyard or charmingly upbeat Provincetown.</p>

    <h2>Rockport</h2>
    <p>Visit Rockport for miles of lovely beaches, boulder-strewn paths through woods and glades, and that uncommonly magical light that has inspired painters since Winslow Homer. Only an hour drive north of Boston, you can enjoy a beach getaway, exquisite dining and a unique shopping experience year round. The waters surrounding Cape Ann beckon scuba divers, kayakers and sailors to explore the bay. Watch for whales or puffins on one of many charters; hike through the wilds of Halibut Point or along the breathtaking Headlands.</p>
